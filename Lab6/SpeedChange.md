### Change ball speed  
- The ball speed is currently 6 pixels per video frame

- Use the slide switches on the Nexys A7-100T board to program the ball speed in the range of 1-32 pixels per frame

  - **WARNING**: Avoid setting the speed to zero as the ball will then never reach the bat or wall  
- See how fast to move the ball and still keep it in play
