## Lab 5: DAC Siren

Program the FPGA on the Nexys A7-100T board to generate a wailing audio siren using a 24-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC) called Pmod I2S.

[Left_Right_.mp3](https://github.com/jwong881/CPE487/blob/a918aa3974621c323f4edabd37cf057f67550383/Lab5/Left%20right%20.mp3) is the audio from modifying the original program so the tone and wailing speed of the right audio channel is different from the left channel.  
[Squarewave.mp3](https://github.com/jwong881/CPE487/blob/a918aa3974621c323f4edabd37cf057f67550383/Lab5/Squarewave.mp3) is the audio from modifying the previous program that creates a square wave instead of a triangle wave when the upper push button is pressed.  
[Wavespeed.mp3](https://github.com/jwong881/CPE487/blob/a918aa3974621c323f4edabd37cf057f67550383/Lab5/Wavespeed.mp3) is the audio created from modifying the previous program so that the wailing speed is controled by the switches on the board.
