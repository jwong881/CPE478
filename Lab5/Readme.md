## Lab 5: DAC Siren

Program the FPGA on the Nexys A7-100T board to generate a wailing audio siren using a 24-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC) called Pmod I2S.

Sirenoriginal.mp3 is a recording of the audio from the unmodified siren program.  
Left_Right_.mp3 is the audio from modifying the original program so the tone and wailing speed of the right audio channel is different from the left channel.  
Squarewave.mp3 is the audio from modifying the previous program that creates a square wave instead of a triangle wave when the upper push button is pressed.  
Wavespeed.mp3 is the audio created from modifying the previous program so that the wailing speed is controled by the switches on the board.
