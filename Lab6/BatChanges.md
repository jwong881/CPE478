### Change bat width and count hits
- Double the width of the bat to make the game really easy

- Modify the code so that the bat width decreases one pixel each time successfully hitting the ball and then resets to starting width when missing the ball

- See how many times hitting the ball in a row as the bat slowly shrinks

- Count the number of successful hits after each serve and display the count in binary on the 7-segment displays of the Nexys A7-100T board
